amqp_setup.py:
    1. defines channel, connection, exchange and queue properties
    2. create_exchange function: create new exchange by providing room_id to set exchange name as room_id_fanout (whenever a new room is created)
    3. create_queue function: create new queue by providing user_id as routing key (whenever a user joins a room chat) (routing key is mostly a formality since exchange is fanout)
    4. check_setup gets channel, connection running
